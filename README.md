# Horiseon-Marketing
Semantic website for Horiseon Marketing

Code refactored for accessibility and search engine optimization.

1. Replaced divs with semantic elements such as nav, header, main, section, aside, footer.
2. Replaced div containing image of a "developer meeting" with an img tag, moving href from CSS file to the img tag in the HTML file.
3. Added descriptive alt attributes for images.
4. Added and modified classes in order to consolidate CSS code and have class names be clear, descriptive, and highly specific.
5. Made navigation bar fixed to the top of the viewport.
6. Commented out sections of CSS file to show what group of elements were being modified.
7. Repaired id for "search-engine-optimization" so that the navbar link leads to that section. 
8. Changed title to "Horiseon Search Engine Optimization."
